# NoHurtCam-BE
Collection of modified camera files to remove the hurt-camera shake in MCBE.

I have made modified cameras for all common minecraft versions. If the ones you tried didn't work, I suggest trying an older or newer version of the cameras here.

The file layout and locations of the camera files in this repo match the file locations in each game version. to replace camera files, use the bedrocklauncher or iobit unlocker.
